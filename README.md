## Contribution

If there are any bugs or feature requests, write them [here](https://github.com/danielh-official/markdown-post-writer/issues).

### Local Development

Fork the repo and clone it to your device.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/markdown-post-writer.git
cd markdown-post-writer
```

In the terminal for your cloned repository, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result (or, if that port is unavailable, look at the output from running the `dev` command in your terminal to get the correct url).

Changes should preview immediately :)

### Deploying Your Own Instance

The main instance is deployed using Vercel. See Vercel documentation about deploying a Next.js project from a GitHub repository and deploy your fork.
